Five different benchmarks have been created to get better insight of how fast-sort perform under different scenarios.
Each benchmark is run with different array sizes raging from small 100 items to large 100 000 items.

Every run of benchmark outputs different results but the results are constantly showing better scores compared to similar popular sorting libraries.
